          <p class="lead mb-1">Who am I?</p>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Jacob, an experienced gameplay programmer currently working at <a href="https://cloudimperiumgames.com/">Cloud Imperium Games</a>.
            I'm passionate about delivering fun and high quality gameplay features to my players and efficient internal workflows to my colleagues.
            At CIG I've had the pleasure of creating features such as Loot Generation and Salvage, maintaining existing features, and building tools for designers 
            and other developers to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not making games I'm often playing them, and have been greatly inspired by the works of 
            <a href="https://factorio.com/team">Wube software</a>,
            <a href="https://www.coffeestainstudios.com/">Coffee Stain Studios</a>, and 
            <a href="https://re-logic.com/">Re-logic</a>, who've made some of my favourite games to-date.
            I'm a huge fan of the social aspect of cooperative and multiplayer games, and love to be part of creating those experiences for players.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other than games, I enjoy working out, martial arts, scuba diving and generally experiencing new things.
            My curiosity has led me to fly planes, gyrocopters, and helicopters, try indoor skydiving, rockclimbing, and surfboarding, 
            and even blacksmithing my own sword! I'm always looking for more activities and experiences to expand my world view.
          </p>

          <p class="lead mb-1">How did I get here?</p>
          <p>
            I've been interested in technology and games for my whole life, but got hooked on programming during my Computing
            A-level. The challenge and creative freedom programming presented was like nothing I'd experienced before, and since then I've known 
            that it's a programmer's life for me! I went on to study a BSc in Computer Science at Warwick University to give me a firm
            knowledge of the fundamentals, followed by a Software Development internship at Amazon for some real world experience. I then took on
            an MSc in Computer Games Technology to help me specialize in games, and from there I was on to Cloud Imperium Games to kickstart my career.
          </p>

          <p class="lead mb-1">What's next?</p>
          <p>
            My goal is to become a Lead programmer capable of mentoring teammates, designing complex features, and managing the workload and schedule of the team.
            To work towards this I learn from talented colleagues through code reviews and discussions, work closely with designers to ensure we strike the best
            possible balance between creative vision and technical feasibility, and engage with producers to help triage issues, schedule work, and run meetings.

          <p>Hello! I'm Jacob, an aspiring game developer who recently finished a Masters in Computer Games Technology at City, University of London.
            On this website you can see some of my <a href="portfolio.html">projects</a>, and get to know a bit more about who I am and what I do!</p>
          <p>I've been interested in technology and games for my whole life, but got hooked on programming during my Computing

            knowledge of the fundamentals, followed by a Software Development internship at Amazon for some real world experience. I then took on
            an MSc in Computer Games Technology to help me specialise in games, which has given me skills in Unity, Monogame
            and OpenGL, as well as knowledge of game design and architecture that will support my future career.
          </p>                 
          <p>
            Now I'm looking for entry level positions as a gameplay programmer, with the goal of working my way up to a 
            team leader role in future.

            and I recently blacksmithed my own sword! I'm always looking for more activities and experiences to expand my world view.
